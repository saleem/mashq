A tongue-firmly-in-cheek PHP program
==========================

The simple PHP file attached does the cheeky little business of deleting all PHP files in the current directory. That is, the directory from where you run this program. This can (although it doesn't have to) be the directory that contains this cheeky little PHP file -- in which case it will duly delete itself, as well.

I call this cheeky little business "refactoring" -- since deleting obnoxious code is the best refactoring; and this cheeky little program is nothing if not obnoxious.

Hopefully, along the way, to someone, somewhere, this cheeky little program outlines the basics of PHP programming; and serves as a PHunner PHirst PHP program than 

```php
<?php print "Hello World\n"?>
```

would be.
