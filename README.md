mashq
=====

A conglomeration of code snippets in multiple languages, using different APIs. Each is stand-alone.


A Project With Sundry Tutorials
===============================

This project has one or more folders with simple tutorials in different tools and APIs. Rather than create a plethora of "Hello World" clones in a variety of technologies; I've lumped them together here. It's the ultimate Tower of Babel: since there are many languages spoken herein. However, since each example is very simple, it's not a very tall tower. Consider this the Tower of Hanoi in Babel.


Etymology
=========

"Mashq" (مشق) means "practice" in Urdu.
